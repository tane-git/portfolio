        <p>Enspiral Dev Academy was a 15-week intensive bootcamp that I completed at the end of 2021.</p>
        <p>My cohort and I got stuck in, developing Full Stack Web Applications as team in an intense but supportive environment</p>
        <p>Friday Projects were randomly selected teams, brainstorming a random and fun app idea to develop, to reinforce the tech we had learnt that week. They were fast-paced and hands-on and resulted in messy but inspiring results, proving to ourselfs how much we could accomplish in just 1 day if we worked as team.</p>
